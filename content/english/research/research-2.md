Health inequalities are a major societal challenge, and evidence suggests that health inequality is established in childhood and may even transcend generations. More importantly, multiple forms of adversity intersect with each other, and disadvantaged children are often exposed to adversity across multiple biological, health, social, neighborhood, and environmental layers. In the LAYERS project we will investigate the multiple layers of adversity which generate inequality over the life course and across generations with the vision to help us break vicious circles of adversity and identifying children and families who would benefit from targeted support. In the ALFADIAB project, we are researching clinical decision-making from an algorithmic perspective. We aim to audit existing models and build updated algorithms for equitable prognostic clinical prediction of physical and mental disease outcomes as a possible entry-point to narrowing healthcare inequalities. In our project related to employment and inequalities, we focus on how employment quality as well as the digitalization of the labor market result in health inequalities across the lifespan, especially among existing vulnerable groups in the labor market.
