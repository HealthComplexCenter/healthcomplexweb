The vision of the Copenhagen Health Complexity Center is to understand real-world health complexities among young adults. The health and social issue, which arise during this life period, affect not only the individual, but also their families, their workplaces, and may have long-lasting effects on later life health and social trajectories. However, the causes and consequences of these health and social issues are intertwined, complex and often understudied, and fundamental questions on health and social issues among young adults remain unanswered. By shedding light on the distinct patterns and characteristics of health and social issues in this age group, the Center aims to address the underlying dynamics that contribute to these problems. This research theme is funded by TrygFonden.
