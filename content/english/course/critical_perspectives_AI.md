### Aim and content
This is a generic course. This means that the course is reserved for PhD students at the Graduate School of Health and Medical Sciences at UCPH.

Anyone can apply for the course, but if you are not a PhD student at the Graduate School, you will be placed on the waiting list until enrollment deadline. After the enrolment deadline, available seats will be allocated to the waiting list.

The course is free of charge for PhD students at Danish universities (except Copenhagen Business School), and for PhD students at NorDoc member faculties. All other participants must pay the course fee.

### Learning objectives
A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:

- Utilise conceptual frameworks developed in Science and Technology Studies, critical theory, and the nascent field of critical algorithmic studies to understand ‘artificial intelligence’ not only as a kind of computing, but also as a ‘form of knowledge production, a paradigm for social organization and a political project’ (Resisting AI, 2023).
- Trace the historical development of the field of ‘artificial intelligence’ and ‘machine learning’ and its ideological underpinnings from its roots in eugenics and race science in the 19th century to the modern-day nexus of ideologies at the intersection of transhumanism, longtermism, and Effective Altruism.
- Think critically about the purported benefits of automation, stay cognizant of its hidden costs, and holistically assess the tradeoff between the two when engaging with ‘artificial intelligence’ in own research or daily lives.
- Substitute the catch-all marketing term ‘artificial intelligence’ with language more accurately describing particular kinds of automation.
- Reject the idea of technological progress as inevitable and deterministic and assume an active role in deciding on the kinds of future towards which we may want to strive.

### Content
Ubiquity of ‘artificial intelligence’, from risk assessment models to generative ‘AI’, has seen explosive growth ever since the deep learning boom that started in the early 2010s. New architectures, tools, and applications are constantly being presented to the general public, academics, and businesses as the next big thing that will democratise education, research, and healthcare, help address every societal crisis, and generally bring about a prosperous future, in a flurry of competing offerings so high-paced that we rarely have time to pause and ask critical – and critically important – questions. Even though a growing number of voices are raising concerns about the broader societal and ecological implications of the bundle of technologies collectively referred to as ‘AI’, these voices are often drowned out by the narrative pushed by the companies at the helm of the current ‘AI’ boom, contributing to the growing disconnect between perspectives on technology developed in the humanities and those held by practitioners in the fields of machine learning and data science.

This course makes a step towards bridging this gape by providing an introduction to critical algorithmic studies, science and technology studies, and critical theory and enabling students to apply lenses developed in these fields to more holistically think about ‘artificial intelligence’ and the consequences of deployment of automation. Rather than accepting the narrow techno-optimist view of ‘AI’, which encourages us to treat it as a neutral tool and to ignore historical and political context in which technology is developed and deployed, the students will be equipped to situate it within a rich – and often murky – context that should shape our engagement with automation tools in research and beyond.

### Participants
PhD students who have interest in thinking about ‘artificial intelligence’ more holistically. Students of all levels of hands-on experience with all forms of ‘AI’ are welcome to join the course. The maximum number of participants is 20.
In case the course is forced into an online setting (e.g., due to COVID-19), the lectures can be attended by others, but the practical exercises are always limited to the max. 20 signed up participants.

### Relevance to graduate programmes
The course will be relevant for a large number of graduate programmes due to the deepening penetration of various forms of ‘artificial intelligence’ into most stages of research. However, it is the most relevant for the following three programmes:

- Public Health and Epidemiology
- Biostatistics and Bioinformatics
- Clinical Research

### Language
English

### Form
A mix of lectures, case studies, and roundtable discussions.
