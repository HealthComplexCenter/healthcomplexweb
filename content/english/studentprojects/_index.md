At the Copenhagen Health Complexity Center we regularly supervise bachelor's and master's projects. If you have an idea for a project that you would like to work on, please reach out to us so we can discuss the possibilities. We recommend that you look at our researchers' profiles to see if there is someone who is working on a topic that interests you.
