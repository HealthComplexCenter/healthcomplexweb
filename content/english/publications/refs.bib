  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel framework for the development of interventions in vulnerable populations. The framework combines a complex systems lens with syndemic theory. Whereas funding bodies, research organizations and reporting guidelines tend to encourage intervention research that (i) focuses on singular and predefined health outcomes, (ii) searches for generalizable cause-effect relationships, and (iii) aims to identify universally effective interventions, the paper suggests that a different direction is needed for addressing health inequities: We need to (i) start with exploratory analysis of population-level data, and (ii) invest in contextualized in-depth knowledge of the complex dynamics that produce health inequities in specific populations and settings, while we (iii) work with stakeholders at multiple levels to create change within systems.},

  abstract = {Public health and the underlying disease processes are complex, often involving the interaction of biologic, social, psychologic, economic, and other processes that may be nonlinear and adaptive and have other features of complex systems. There is therefore a need to push the boundaries of public health beyond single-factor data analysis and expand the capacity of research methodology to tackle real-world complexities. This article sets out a way to operationalize complex systems thinking in public health, with a particular focus on how epidemiologic methods and data can contribute towards this end. Our proposed framework comprises three core dimensions---patterns, mechanisms, and dynamics---along which complex systems may be conceptualized. These dimensions cover seven key features of complex systems---emergence, interactions, nonlinearity, interference, feedback loops, adaptation, and evolution. We relate this framework to examples of methods and data traditionally used in epidemiology. We conclude that systematic production of knowledge on complex health issues may benefit from: formulation of research questions and programs in terms of the core dimensions we identify, as a comprehensive way to capture crucial features of complex systems; integration of traditional epidemiologic methods with systems methodology such as computational simulation modeling; interdisciplinary work; and continued investment in a wide range of data types. We believe that the proposed framework can support the systematic production of knowledge on complex health problems, with the use of epidemiology and other disciplines. This will help us understand emergent health phenomena, identify vulnerable population groups, and detect leverage points for promoting public health.},

  abstract = {This paper presents causal loop diagrams (CLDs) as tools for studying complex public health problems like health inequality. These problems often involve feedback loops---a characteristic of complex systems not fully integrated into mainstream epidemiology. CLDs are conceptual models that visualize connections between system variables. They are commonly developed through literature reviews or participatory methods with stakeholder groups. These diagrams often uncover feedback loops among variables across scales (e.g. biological, psychological and social), facilitating cross-disciplinary insights. We illustrate their use through a case example involving the feedback loop between sleep problems and depressive symptoms. We outline a typical step-by-step process for developing CLDs in epidemiology. These steps are defining a specific problem, identifying the key system variables involved, mapping these variables and analysing the CLD to find new insights and possible intervention targets. Throughout this process, we suggest triangulating between diverse sources of evidence, including domain knowledge, scientific literature and empirical data. CLDs can also be evaluated to guide policy changes and future research by revealing knowledge gaps. Finally, CLDs may be iteratively refined as new evidence emerges. We advocate for more widespread use of complex systems tools, like CLDs, in epidemiology to better understand and address complex public health problems.},
