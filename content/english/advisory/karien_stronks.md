### About Me

Karien Stronks seeks to generate evidence on how the position of an individual in society impacts his/her health and – at the population level – leads to inequalities in health. For 30 years, she has focused on understanding why health inequalities arise and how to effectively combat them. During the last 15-20 years, she has undertaken this task as Professor of Public Health. Stronks completed observational studies using a wide range of study designs (cross-sectional and cohort studies, international comparative studies, questionnaire validation, qualitative studies) to map the mechanisms underlying socio-economic and ethnic inequalities in health, related to biomedical (e.g. cardiovascular risks), behavioural (e.g. dietary habits) and psychosocial factors (e.g. discrimination), and health care (e.g. adverse events). Furthermore, she has studied the effectiveness of possible strategies to prevent these inequalities from arising, through randomised controlled trials (e.g. culturally targeted intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus), natural experiments (e.g. impact of urban regeneration programme on mental health), developmental evaluations (e.g. role of a knowledge broker in health policy at the local level) and process evaluations (e.g. conditions for a successful development of intersectoral local health policy). To embrace the complexity of public health problems, Stronks has recently applied ‘systems science’ tools - including computational models - to understand inequalities as well as to develop strategies to effectively reduce them.
