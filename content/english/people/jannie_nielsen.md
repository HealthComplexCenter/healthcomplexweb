### About Me

My primary research interest is centered on the complexity of chronic conditions, related risk factors, and social relations. I focus on how chronic conditions and related risk factors are shaped, shared, spread and interact in social network such as families, and how social networks influence disease management and access to treatment and care. Further, I have a strong interest in disparities in chronic conditions.

The primary goal of my research is to provide novel insights on the role of social networks and disparities in risk of chronic conditions and access to care. Risk factors for major chronic diseases are by now well-known; the challenge for public health is to prevent these.

I have investigated chronic conditions (particularly obesity and type 2 diabetes) qualitatively and quantitatively; in families, couples, and parents and their children; collected primary data in Uganda and Vietnam, and worked with secondary data from Denmark, United Kingdom, India, and the United States.

I have a background in Human Physiology and a PhD in Global Health from University of Copenhagen. I have minors in Geography from University of Copenhagen and Public Health from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In 2015, I was awarded with a 2-year postdoctoral fellowship from the Danish Council for Independent Research with allowed me to spend 1 year at Emory University Rollins School of Publisc Health, USA. In 2017, I was awarded with an international mobility fellowship from Independent Research Fund Denmark to spent additional two years at Emory University, USA as a visiting Assisting Professor.

I am Co-Investigator on NIH and DANIDA grants. Internationally, I have accessed grant applications from Medical Research Council UK.
