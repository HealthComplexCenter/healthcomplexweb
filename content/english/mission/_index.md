## Mission

Our mission at the Copenhagen Health Complexity Center is to improve human lives in Denmark and globally by investigating and analyzing complex health and social issues. Through collaboration and interdisciplinary research on health complexity, we seek to address the underlying dynamics of public-health challenges.

## Vision

The Copenhagen Health Complexity Center’s vision is to understand real-world health complexities and develop a strong scientific basis for public health. This is an important milestone toward fair and equal public-health systems that pay attention to the specific health needs of vulnerable populations. To fulfill this vision, our research is organized around:

-> a core research agenda on health complexity in relation to concepts, data, methods, and culture, which provides a systematic approach for generating knowledge on complex health issues at the population level;

-> a strategic research focus on young adults’ health and health inequality; and

-> a strong program for achieving impact and outreach in society.
