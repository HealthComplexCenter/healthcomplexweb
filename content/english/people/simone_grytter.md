### About Me

I work as curator and project manager for the Appendix project at medical Museion, Department of Public Health and NNF Centre for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR).

I have a background in visual and medical anthropology, and a PhD from Medical Museion. Please get in touch if you have any questions, are interested in collaborations, events, and proposals, or if you would simply like to hear more.
