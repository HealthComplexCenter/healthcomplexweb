### About Me

I work as a research assistant on the SmartSleep Program. My project focuses on correlations between sleep, nighttime smartphone use, and co-sleeping. I am at the beginning of my career and am curious about broadening my competencies. I have a bachelor’s degree in sociology and a master’s in social scientific data analysis from Lund University (Sweden). My earlier research experience from work during my studies and my thesis has focused on residential segregation, school segregation, and equal access to quality education.
