### About Me

As a scientist, my primary objective is to conduct interdisciplinary research that goes beyond the traditional boundaries of scientific disciplines. Specifically, I’m interested in utilizing and advancing computational methods to tackle complex medical issues, including chronic multifactorial diseases. To this end, I use both expert- and data-driven computational science methods, such as system dynamics, agent-based modeling, and multi-scale modeling, to gain new insights and simulate interventions.

During my PhD research, I focused on the intricate disease pathways and feedback loops involved in Alzheimer's disease. Currently, as a postdoctoral researcher, I’m exploring the complex connections between sleep problems and depressive symptoms. By leveraging systems thinking tools and techniques, I aim to reveal the underlying mechanisms that link these two issues and identify potential interventions that might improve mental health outcomes. 

Overall, my research is fueled by a deep commitment to improving human health and well-being by understanding and unraveling the complexities of the underlying biopsychosocial systems.
