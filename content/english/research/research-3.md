At the Copenhagen Health Complexity Center, we develop practical tools for analyzing complex health problems. We design frameworks and software to bridge qualitative and quantitative modeling. Our approach is grounded in the triangulation of theory- and expert-driven research to enhance the robustness and validity of our findings. By synthesizing complex systems methodologies, such as system dynamics, with causal inference techniques, we strive to deliver actionable insights that can inform health policy and clinical practice. This research theme is funded by TrygFonden and RUBICON.
