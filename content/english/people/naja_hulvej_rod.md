### About Me

Naja Hulvej Rod is Professor of Epidemiology and Director of the Copenhagen Health Complexity Center at the University of Copenhagen, which is a multi-disciplinary research hub dedicated to developing a systematic scientific approach for understanding and addressing complex public health problems. Her expertise spans various domains including sleep, health inequality, young adult health, and early life adversity, with a focus on health complexity, causal inference, and life course mechanisms. She is leading the interdisciplinary Complexity and Big Data Group, which aims at studying the social and biological factors determining health and disease across the life span. She has a particular interest in complex systems theory and how it intersects with methodological insights from causal inference theory. She has extensive expertise in working with longitudinal datasets and register-based research. She is elected Chair of Council for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, and she has participated in numerous boards and committees across Europe, including the Swedish Research Council, the Finnish Research Council, and the French Health Data Hub. She has been awarded several prestigious grants and awards including the Sapere Aude starting grant, the Elite Researcher Prize 2022, and an ERC consolidator grant.
