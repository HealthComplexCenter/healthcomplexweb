## ABOUT US

We, at the Copenhagen Health Complexity Center, are dedicated to advancing the understanding and management of complex public health challenges, particularly focusing on young adult health, healthcare inequalities, theoretical and methodological development in complexity science, and outreach and public dissemination concerning public health complexity.

We are currently comprised of professors, associate professors, postdoctoral researchers, and PhD students from various disciplines, including epidemiology, public health, sociology, and computer science. Our group is strengthened by associate researchers and collaborators from the University of Copenhagen and international institutions.
