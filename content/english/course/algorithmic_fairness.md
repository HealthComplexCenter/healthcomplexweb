### Learning objectives
A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:

 - Understand how unfair algorithms have the ability to have tangible impact on human lives.
 - Critically think about concepts of fairness and articulate their own definition of fairness.
 - Understand the main aims of machine learning and the most important metrics of predictive modelling.
 - Understand the differences between equality, equity, justice, and understand the concepts of discrimination, disparate treatment and disparate impact.
 - Understand the differences between group fairness and individual fairness.
 - Critically think about various sources of data biases.
 - Align fairness concepts with the main aims of machine learning.
 - Have an overview of solutions to counteract data biases using various methods.
 - Navigate the growing literature of algorithmic fairness and available software packages.
 - An important objective is to provide inspiration to students from real-life examples and applications from a world of algorithmic fairness.

### Content
Algorithms will soon completely surround us - from college applications, bank loans and the criminal justice system, through self-driving cars to clinical decision making, algorithms are becoming an organic part of our lives. In entering this era, we rely heavily on machine learning (ML) algorithms. In many applications, ML algorithms were designed with the intent of removing preexisting human biases and generate fair decisions using mathematical rules, avoiding biased human judgement. Unfortunately though, societal inequities and biases from various other sources taint the historic data that these algorithms use, further propagating biases into decisions for the future. In addition, while most algorithms are tuned to generate the most accurate predictions, less attention is paid to generate fair and unbiased results. 

This course introduces the fundamentals of algorithmic fairness, introduces the most common biases in machine learning, discusses recent examples from the algorithmic fairness literature and gives an overview of the most common group- and individual fairness metrics. The course will include lectures from the course director and international expert external speakers, and practical exercises that will help students critically assess the biases in data and in the results of machine learning algorithms.

### Participants
PhD students who have interest in algorithmic fairness. The maximum number of participants is 20. This is an introductory level class and no advanced programming skills are required, but students will need to have a basic to intermediate experience with programming in R (or similar, e.g., SPSS, SAS, STATA, Python).

### Relevance to graduate programmes
The course will be relevant for a large number of graduate programmes due to the deepening penetration of various forms of ‘artificial intelligence’ into most stages of research. However, it is the most relevant for the following three programmes:

- Public Health and Epidemiology
- Biostatistics and Bioinformatics
- Medicine, Culture and Society

### Language
English

### Form
A mix of lectures, case studies, and roundtable discussions.
